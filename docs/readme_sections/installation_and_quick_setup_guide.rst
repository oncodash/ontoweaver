Installation and quick setup guide
----------------------------------

Python Module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The project is written in Python and uses
`Poetry <https://python-poetry.org>`__. You can install the necessary
dependencies in a virtual environment like this:

::

   git clone https://github.com/oncodash/ontoweaver.git
   cd ontoweaver
   poetry install

Poetry will create a virtual environment according to your configuration
(either centrally or in the project folder). You can activate it by
running ``poetry shell`` inside the project directory.

If you are using Poetry version ``2.0.0`` or later, you can use ``poetry env activate`` instead of
``poetry shell``. This command will output a line which you should copy and run to activate the environment.
Alternatively, you may use the `poetry-plugin-shell <https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-plugin-shell>`_
plugin to enable the ``poetry shell`` command to work with Poetry ``2.0.0`` or later.

Output Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Theoretically, the graph can be imported in any [graph] database
supported by BioCypher (Neo4j, ArangoDB, CSV, RDF, PostgreSQL, SQLite,
NetworkX, … see `BioCypher’s
documentation <https://biocypher.org/output/index.html>`__).

Graph visualization with Neo4j
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Neo4j is a popular graph database management system that offers a
flexible and efficient way to store, query, and manipulate complex,
interconnected data. Cypher is the query language used to interact with
Neo4j databases. In order to visualize graphs extracted from databases
using OntoWeaver and BioCypher, you can download the `Neo4j Graph
Database Self-Managed <https://neo4j.com/deployment-center/>`__ for your
operating system. It has been extensively tested with the Community
edition.

To create a global variable to Neo4j, add the path to ``neo4j-admin`` to
your ``PATH`` and ``PYTHONPATH``. In order to use the Neo4j browser, you
will need to install the correct Java version, depending on the Neo4j
version you are using, and add the path to ``JAVA_HOME``. OntoWeaver and
BioCypher support versions 4 and 5 of Neo4j.

To run Neo4j (version 5+), use the command ``neo4j-admin server start``
after importing your results via the neo4j import sequence provided in
the ``./biocypher-out/`` directory. Use ``neo4j-admin server stop`` to
disconnect the local server.

Tests
~~~~~

Tests are located in the ``tests/`` subdirectory and may be a good
starting point to see OntoWeaver in practice. You may start with
``tests/test_simplest.py`` which shows the simplest example of mapping
tabular data through BioCypher.

To run tests, use ``pytest``:

::

   poetry run pytest

or, alternatively:

::

   poetry shell
   pytest
