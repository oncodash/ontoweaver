# OntoWeaver

## Overview

OntoWeaver is a tool for importing table data in
Semantic Knowledge Graphs (SKG) databases.

OntoWeaver allows writing a simple declarative mapping to express how columns from
a [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) table are to be converted as typed nodes
or edges in an SKG.

![](docs/OntoWeaver_logo__big.svg)

It provides a simple layer of abstraction on top of [Biocypher](https://biocypher.org),
which remains responsible for doing the ontology alignment,
supporting several graph database backends,
and allowing reproducible & configurable builds.

With a pure Biocypher approach, you would have to write a whole adapter by hand,
with OntoWeaver, you just have to express a mapping in YAML, looking like:
```yaml
row: # The meaning of an entry in the input table.
   map:
      column: <column name in your CSV>
      to_subject: <ontology node type to use for representing a row>

transformers: # How to map cells to nodes and edges.
    - map: # Map a column to a node.
        column: <column name>
        to_object: <ontology node type to use for representing a column>
        via_relation: <edge type for linking subject and object nodes>
    - map: # Map a column to a property.
        column: <another name>
        to_property: <property name>
        for_object: <type holding the property>

metadata: # Optional properties added to every node and edge.
    - source: "My OntoWeaver adapter"
    - version: "v1.2.3"
```

## Installation and quick setup guide

### Python Module

The project is written in Python and uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org).
You can install the necessary dependencies in a virtual environment like this:

```
git clone https://github.com/oncodash/ontoweaver.git
cd ontoweaver
poetry install
```

Poetry will create a virtual environment according to your configuration (either
centrally or in the project folder). You can activate it by running `poetry
shell` inside the project directory.


### Output Database

Theoretically, the graph can be imported in
any [graph] database supported by BioCypher
(Neo4j, ArangoDB, CSV, RDF, PostgreSQL, SQLite, NetworkX, …
see [BioCypher's documentation](https://biocypher.org/output/index.html)).


### Graph visualization with Neo4j

Neo4j is a popular graph database management system that offers a flexible and
efficient way to store, query, and manipulate complex, interconnected data.
Cypher is the query language used to interact with Neo4j databases.
In order to visualize graphs extracted from databases using OntoWeaver and
BioCypher, you can download the
[Neo4j Graph Database Self-Managed](https://neo4j.com/deployment-center/)
for your operating system. It has been extensively tested with the Community edition.

To create a global variable to Neo4j, add the path to `neo4j-admin`
to your `PATH` and `PYTHONPATH`.
In order to use the Neo4j browser, you will need to install the correct
Java version, depending on the Neo4j version you are using, and add the path
to `JAVA_HOME`. OntoWeaver and BioCypher  support versions 4 and 5 of Neo4j.

To run Neo4j (version 5+), use the command `neo4j-admin server start`
after importing your results via the neo4j import sequence provided
in the `./biocypher-out/` directory. Use `neo4j-admin server stop` to disconnect
the local server.


### Tests

Tests are located in the `tests/` subdirectory and may be a good starting point
to see OntoWeaver in practice. You may start with `tests/test_simplest.py` which
shows the simplest example of mapping tabular data through BioCypher.

To run tests, use `pytest`:
```
poetry run pytest
```
or, alternatively:
```
poetry shell
pytest
```


## Usage

OntoWeaver actually automatically provides a working adapter for BioCypher,
without you having to do it.

The output of the execution of the adapter is thus what BioCypher is providing
(see [BioCypher's documentation](https://biocypher.org)).
In a nutshell, the output is a script file that, when executed, will populate
the configured database.
By default, the output script file is saved in a subdirectory of `./biocypher-out/`,
which name is a timestamp from when the adapter has been executed.

To actually insert data in an SKG database, you will have to use Biocypher
export API:
```python
    import yaml
    import pandas as pd
    import biocypher
    import ontoweaver

    # Load ontology
    bc = biocypher.BioCypher(
        biocypher_config_path = "tests/simplest/biocypher_config.yaml",
        schema_config_path = "tests/simplest/schema_config.yaml"
    )

    # Load data
    table = pd.read_csv("tests/simplest/data.csv")

    # Load mapping
    with open("tests/simplest/mapping.yaml") as fd:
        mapping = yaml.full_load(fd)

    # Run the adapter
    adapter = ontoweaver.tabular.extract_all(table, mapping)

    # Write nodes
    bc.write_nodes( adapter.nodes )

    # Write edges
    bc.write_edges( adapter.edges )

    # Write import script
    bc.write_import_call()

    # Now you have a script that you can run to actually insert data.
```

Additionally, you will have to define a strategy for the naming of mapped items
when creating nodes, by defining an `affix` and `separator` to be used during
node creation. The `affix` used will represent the ontology type of the item
in question. Unless otherwise defined, the `affix` defaults to `suffix`
and `separator` defaults to `:`. This can be modified by changing the variables
in the `extract_all()` function. `Affix` can be either a `prefix`, `suffix`
or `none` - in case you decide not to include the ontology type in the node
naming strategy. Special care should be exercised in case there are several
types of the same name in the database. There is a possibility that nodes of the
same name will be merged together during mapping, so an `affix` should
be present. Below are some examples of node naming strategies. `NAME` refers to
the name of the item in question in your database, and `TYPE` refers to the type
of the item in the ontology.

```python
[...]

   # Affix defaults to "suffix", and separator defaults to ":"
   # Node represented as [NAME]:[TYPE]
   adapter = ontoweaver.tabular.extract_all(table, mapping)

   # Node represented as [TYPE]-[NAME]
   adapter = ontoweaver.tabular.extract_all(table, mapping, affix = "prefix", separator = "-")

   # Node represented as [NAME]
   adapter = ontoweaver.tabular.extract_all(table, mapping, affix = "none")

[...]
```


## Mapping API

OntoWeaver essentially creates a Biocypher adapter from the description of a
mapping from a table to ontology types.
As such, its core input is a dictionary, that takes the form of a YAML file.
This configuration file indicates:

- to which (node) type to map each line of the table,
- to which (node) type to map columns of the table,
- with which (edge) types to map relationships between nodes.

The following explanations assume that you are familiar with
[Biocypher's configuration](https://biocypher.org/tutorial-ontology.html),
notably how it handles ontology alignment with
schema configuration.


### Common Mapping

The minimal configuration would be to map lines and one column, linked with
a single-edge type.

For example, if you have the following CSV table of phenotypes/patients:
```
phenotype,patient
0,A
1,B
```
and if you target the Biolink ontology, using a schema configuration
(i.e. subset of types), defined in your `shcema_config.yaml` file, as below:
```yaml
phenotypic feature:
    represented_as: node
    label_in_input: phenotype
case:
    represented_as: node
    label_in_input: case
case to phenotypic feature association:
    represented_as: edge
    label_in_input: case_to_phenotype
    source: phenotypic feature
    target: case
```
you may write the following mapping:
```yaml
row:
   rowIndex:
      # No column is indicated, but OntoWeaver will map the indice of the row to the node name.
      to_subject: phenotype
transformers:
    - map:
        column: patient # Name of the column in the table.
        to_object: case # Node type to export to (most probably the same as in the ontology).
        via_relation: case_to_phenotype # Edge type to export to.

```

This configuration will end in creating a node for each phenotype, a node
for each patient, and an edge for each phenotype-patient pair:
```
          case to phenotypic
          feature association
                    ↓

```


### How to Add an Edge Between Column Nodes

If you need to add an edge between a column node to another (and not between
the line node and a column node), you can use the `from_subject` predicate,
for example:
```yaml
row:
   map:
      to_subject: phenotype
transformers:
    - map:
        column: patient
        to_object: case
        via_relation: case_to_phenotype
    - map:
        column: disease
        from_subject: case # The edge will start from this node type (and not from the "phenotype" subject)...
        to_object: disease # ... to this node type.
        via_relation: disease_to_entity_association_mixin
```

```
           ╭───────────────────╮
           │              ╔════╪════╦════════════════════╗
           │              ║pati│ent ║      disease       ║
           │              ╠════╪════╬════════════════════╣
           │              ║    │    ║disease to          ║
           │              ║    │    ║entity              ║
╭──────────┴──────────╮   ║╭───┴───╮║  ↓    ╭───────────╮║

╰─────────────────────╯   ║╰───────╯║       ╰┬──────────╯║
                          ╠═════════╬════════╪═══════════╣

           │              ╚════╪════╩════════════════════╝
           ╰───────────────────╯
```


### How to Add Properties to Nodes and Edges

If you do not need to create a new node, but simply attach some data to
an existing node, use the `to_property` predicate, for example:
```yaml
row:
   map:
      to_subject: phenotype
transformers:
    - map:
        column: patient
        to_object: case
        via_relation: case_to_phenotype
    - map:
        column: age
        to_property: patient_age
        for_object: case
```
This will add a "patient_age" property to nodes of type "case".

Note that you can add the same property value to several property fields of
several node types:
```yaml
    - map:
        column: age
        to_properties:
            - patient_age
            - age_patient
        for_object:
            - case
            - phenotype
```


### Available Transformers

If you want to transform a data cell before exporting it as one or several
nodes, you will use other *transformers* than the "map" one.


#### `map`

The *map* transformer simply extracts the value of the cell defined,
and is the most common way of mapping cell values.

For example:
```yaml
    - map:
        column: patient
        to_object: case
```

Although the examples usually define a mapping of cell values to nodes,
the transformers can also used to map cell values to properties
of nodes and edges. For example:

```yaml
    - map:
        column: version
        to_property: version
        for_objects:
            - patient # Node type.
            - variant
            - patient_has_variant # Edge type.
```


#### `split`

The *split* transformer separates a string on a separator, into several items,
and then inserts a node for each element of the list.

For example, if you have a list of treatments separated by a semicolon,
you may write:
```yaml
row:
   map:
      to_subject: phenotype
transformers:
    - map:
        column: variant
        to_object: variant
        via_relation: phenotype_to_variant
    - split:
        column: treatments
        from_subject: variant
        to_object: drug
        via_relation: variant_to_drug
        separator: ";"

```

```
     phenotype to variant      variant to drug
             ↓                       ↓
       ╭───────────────╮   ╭────────────────╮
       │         ╔═════╪═══╪═╦══════════════╪═════╗
       │         ║ vari│ant│ ║  treatments  │     ║
       │         ╠═════╪═══╪═╬══════════════╪═════╣
       │         ║     │   │ ║variant       │     ║
       │         ║     │   │ ║to drug       │     ║
╭──────┴─────╮   ║╭────┴───┴╮║  ↓    ╭──╮ ╭─┴────╮║

╰────────────╯   ║╰─────────╯║       ╰┬─╯ ╰──────╯║
                 ╠═══════════╬════════╪═══════════╣
╭────────────╮   ║╭─────────╮║       ╭│ ╮ ╭──╮    ║
│      1     │   ║│    B    ├╫────────╯X ;│ Z│    ║
╰──────┬─────╯   ║╰────┬───┬╯║       ╰  ╯ ╰─┬╯    ║
       │         ╚═════╪═══╪═╩══════════════╪═════╝
       ╰───────────────╯   ╰────────────────╯
```


#### `cat`

The *cat* transformer concatenates the values cells of the defined columns
and then inserts a single node. For example, the mapping below would result
in the concatenation of cell values from the columns `variant_id`,
and `disease`, to the node type `variant`. The values are concatenated
in the order written in the `columns` section.

```yaml
row:
   cat:
      columns: # List of columns whose cell values are to be concatenated
        - variant_id
        - disease
      to_subject: variant # The ontology type to map to
```


#### `cat_format`

The user can also define the order and format of concatenation by creating
a `format_string` field, which defines the format of the concatenation.
For example:

```yaml
row:
   cat_format:
      columns: # List of columns whose cell values are to be concatenated
        - variant_id
        - disease
      to_subject: variant # The ontology type to map to
      # Enclose column names in brackets where you want their content to be:
      format_string: "{disease}_____{variant_id}"
```


#### `string`

The *string* transformer allows mapping the same pre-defined static string
to properties of *some* nodes or edge types.

It only needs the string *value*, and then a regular property mapping:
```yaml
    - string:
        value: "This may be useful"
        to_property: comment
        for_objects:
            - patient
            - variant
```


#### `translate`

The *translate* transformer changes the targeted cell value from the one
contained in the input table to another one, as configured through (another)
mapping, extracted from (another) table.

This is useful to *reconciliate* two sources of data using two different
references for the identifiers of the same object. The translate transformer
helps you translate one of the identifiers to the other reference, so that
the resulting graph only uses one reference, and there is no duplicated
information at the end.

For instance, let's say that you have two input tables providing information
about the same gene, but one is using the HGCN names, and the other the
Ensembl gene IDs:

| Name  | Source        |
| ----- | ------------- |
| BRCA2 | PMID:11207365 |

| Gene            | Organism     |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| ENSG00000139618 | Mus musculus |

Then, to map a gene from the second table (the one using Ensembl),
you would do:
```yaml
    - translate:
        column: Gene
        to_object: gene
        translations:
            ENSG00000139618: BRCA2
```

Of course, there could be hundreds of thousands of translations to declare,
and you don't want to declare them by hand in the mapping file.
Fortunately, you have access to another table in a CSV file,
showing which one corresponds to the other:

| Ensembl         | HGCN  | Status   |
| --------------- | ----- | -------- |
| ENSG00000139618 | BRCA2 | Approved |

Then, to declare a translation using this table, you would do:
```yaml
    - translate:
        column: Gene
        to_object: gene
        translations_file: <myfile.csv>
        translate_from: Ensembl
        translate_to: HGCN
```

To load the translation file, OntoWeaver uses
[Pandas' read_csv](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html)
function. You may pass additional string arguments in the mapping section,
they will be passed directly as `read_csv` arguments. For example:
```yaml
    - translate:
        column: Gene
        to_object: gene
        translations_file: <myfile.csv.zip>
        translate_from: Ensembl
        translate_to: HGCN
        sep: ;
        compression: zip
        decimal: ,
        encoding: latin-1
```

#### replace

The *replace* transformer allows the removal of forbidden characters from the values extracted from
cells of the data frame. The pattern matching the characters that are *forbidden* characters should be passed to the 
transformer as a regular expression. For example:

```yaml
    - replace:
        columns:
            - treatment
        to_object: drug
        via_relation: alteration_biomarker_for_drug
        forbidden: '[^0-9]' # Pattern matching all characters that are not numeric. 
        # Therefore, you only allow numeric characters. 
        substitute: "_" # Substitute all removed characters with an underscore, in case they are  
        # located inbetween allowed_characters.

```

Here we define that the transformer should only allow numeric characters in the values extracted from the *treatment* column. 
All other characters will be removed and substituted with an underscore, in case they are located inbetween allowed characters.

By default, the transformer will allow alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), underscore (_), backtick (`), dot (.), 
and parentheses (), and the substitute will be an empty string. If you wish to use the default settings, you can write:

```yaml
    - replace:
        columns:
            - treatment
        to_object: drug
        via_relation: alteration_biomarker_for_drug
```

Let's assume we want to map a table consisting of contact IDs and phone numbers.


| id       | phone_number |
|----------|--------------|
| Jennifer | 01/23-45-67  |

We want to map the `id` column to the node type `id` and the `phone_number` column to the node type `phone_number`,
but we want to remove all characters that are not numeric, using the default substitute (""), meaning the forbidden
characters will only be removed, and not replaced by another character. The mapping would look like this:

```yaml
row:
    map:
        column: id
        to_subject: id
transformers:
    - replace:
        column: phone_number
        to_object: phone_number
        via_relation: phone_number_of_person
        forbidden: '[^0-9]'
```

The result of this mapping would be a node of type `phone_number`, with the id of the node being `01234567`, connected to
a node of type `id` with the id `Jennifer`, via an edge of type `phone_number_of_person`.

### User-defined Transformers

It is easy to create your own transformer, if you want to operate complex
data transformations, but still have them referenced in the mapping.

This may even be a good idea if you do some pre-processing on the input table,
as it keeps it obvious for anyone able to read the mapping
(while it may be difficult to read the pre-processing code itself).

A user-defined transformer takes the form of a Python class inheriting from
`ontoweaver.base.Transformer`:
```python
class my_transformer(ontoweaver.base.Transformer):

    # The constructor is called when parsing the YAML mapping.
    def __init__(self, target, properties_of, edge=None, columns=None, **kwargs):

        # All the arguments passed to the super class are available as member variables.
        super().__init__(target, properties_of, edge, columns, **kwargs)

        # If you want user-defined parameters, you may get them from
        # the corresponding member variables (e.g. `self.my_param`).
        # However, if you want to have a default value if they are not declared
        # by the user in the mapping, you have to get them from kwargs:
        self.my_param = kwargs.get("my_param", None) # Defaults to None.

    # The call interface is called when processing a row.
    def __call__(self, row, index):

        # You should take care of your parameters:
        if not self.my_param:
            raise ValueError("You forgot the `my_param` keyword")

        # The columns declared by the user (with the "column(s)" keyword)
        # are available as a member variable:
        for col in self.columns:
            # Some methods of base.Transformer may be useful, like `valid`
            # which checks whether a cell value is something useful.
            if self.valid(row[col]):
                result = row[col]
                # […] Do something of your own with row[col] […]
                # You are finally required to yield a string:
                yield str(result)
```

Once your transformer class is implemented, you should make it available to the
`ontoweaver` module which will process the mapping:
```python
ontoweaver.transformer.register(my_transformer)
```

You can have a look at the transformers provided by OntoWeaver to get
inspiration for your own implementation:
[ontoweaver/src/ontoweaver/transformer.py](https://github.com/oncodash/ontoweaver/blob/main/src/ontoweaver/transformer.py)


### Keywords Synonyms

Because several communities gathered around semantic knowledge graphs,
several terms can be used (more or less) interchangeably.

OntoWeaver thus allows you to use your favorite vocabulary to write down
the mapping configurations.

Here is the list of available synonyms:

- `subject` = `row` = `entry` = `line` = `source`
- `column` = `columns` = `fields`
- `to_object` = `to_target` = `to_node`
- `from_subject` = `from_source`
- `via_relation` = `via_edge` = `via_predicate`
- `to_property` = `to_properties`
- `for_object` = `for_objects`


### How To

#### How to Extract Additional Edges

Edges can be extracted from the mapping configuration, by defining a
`from_subject` and `to_object` in the mapping configuration,
where the `from_subject` is the node type from which the edge will start,
and the `to_object` is the node type to which the edge will end.

For example, consider the following mapping configuration
for the sample dataset below:

```
id	patient	        sample
0	patient1	sample1
1	patient2	sample2
2	patient3	sample3
3	patient4	sample4
```

```yaml
row:
    map:
        column: id
        to_subject: variant
transformers:
    - map:
          column: patient
          to_object: patient
          via_relation: patient_has_variant
    - map:
          column: sample
          to_object: sample
          via_relation: variant_in_sample
```

If the user would like to extract an additional edge
from the node type `patient` to the node type `sample`, they would need
to add the following section to the transformers in the mapping configuration:
```yaml
    - map:
        column: patient
        from_subject: sample
        to_object: patient
        via_relation: sample_to_patient
```


#### How to add the same metadata properties to all nodes and edges

Metadata can be added to nodes and edges by defining a `metadata` section
in the mapping configuration. You can specify all the property keys and values
that you wish to add to your nodes and edges in a `metadata` section.
For example:
```yaml
metadata:
        - name: oncokb
        - url: https://oncokb.org/
        - license: CC BY-NC 4.0
        - version: 0.1
```

The metadata defined in the `metadata` section will be added to all nodes and
edges created during the mapping process.


#### How to add the column of origin as a property to all nodes

In addition to the user-defined metadata, a property field
`add_source_column_names_as` is also available. It allows to indicate the column
name in which the data was found, as a property to each *node*. Note that this
is not added to *edges*, because they are not mapped from a column *per se*.

For example, if the label of a node is extracted from the "indication" column,
and you indicate `add_source_column_name_as: source_column`, the node will have
a property: `source_column: indication`.

This can be added to the metadata section as follows:
```yaml
metadata:
        - name: oncokb
        - url: https://oncokb.org/
        - license: CC BY-NC 4.0
        - version: 0.1
        - add_source_column_names_as: sources
```
Now each of the nodes contains a property `sources` that contains the names
of the source columns from which it was extracted. Be sure to include all
the added node properties in the schema configuration file, to ensure that
the properties are correctly added to the nodes.


#### How to create user-defined adapters

You may manually define your own adapter class, inheriting
from the OntoWeaver's class that manages tabular mappings.

For example:
```python
class MYADAPTER(ontoweaver.tabular.PandasAdapter):

    def __init__(self,
        df: pd.DataFrame,
        config: dict,
        type_affix: Optional[ontoweaver.tabular.TypeAffixes] = ontoweaver.tabular.TypeAffixes.prefix,
        type_affix_sep: Optional[str] = "//",
    ):
        # Default mapping as a simple config.
        from . import types
        parser = ontoweaver.tabular.YamlParser(config, types)
        mapping = parser()

        super().__init__(
            df,
            *mapping,
        )
```
When manually defining adapter classes, be sure to define the affix type
and separator you wish to use in the mapping. Unless otherwise defined,
the affix type defaults to `suffix`, and the separator defaults to `:`.
In the example above, the affix type is defined as `prefix` and the separator
is defined as `//`. If you wish to define affix as `none`, you should use
`type_affix: Optional[ontoweaver.tabular.TypeAffixes] = ontoweaver.tabular.TypeAffixes.none`,
and if you wish to define affix type as `suffix`, use
`type_affix: Optional[ontoweaver.tabular.TypeAffixes] = ontoweaver.tabular.TypeAffixes.suffix`.


#### How to access dynamic Node and Edge Types

OntoWeaver relies a lot on meta-programming, as it actually creates
Python types while parsing the mapping configuration.
By default, those classes are dynamically created into the `ontoweaver.types`
module.

You may manually define your own types, derivating from `ontoweaver.base.Node`
or `ontoweaver.base.Edge`.

The `ontoweaver.types` module automatically gathers the list of available types
in the `ontoweaver.types.all` submodule.
This allows accessing the list of node and edge types:
```python
node_types  = types.all.nodes()
edge_types  = types.all.edges()
```

### Parallel Processing

OntoWeaver provides a way to parallelize the extraction of nodes and edges from the provided database, with the aim of
reducing the runtime of the extraction process. By default, the parallel processing is disabled, and the data frame
is processed in a sequential manner. To enable parallel processing, the user can pass the maximum number of workers to 
the `extract_all` function. 

For example, to enable parallel processing with 16 workers, the user can call the function as follows:

```python
adapter = ontoweaver.tabular.extract_all(table, mapping, parallel_mapping = 16)
```
To enable parallel processing with a good default working on any machine, you can use the [approach suggested by the concurrent module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor).
```python
import os
adapter = ontoweaver.tabular.extract_all(table, mapping, parallel_mapping = min(32, (os.process_cpu_count() or 1) + 4))

### Information Fusion

When integrating several sources of information to create your own SKG,
you will inevitably face a case where two sources provide different information
for the same object. If you process each source with a separate mapping applied
to separate input tables, then each will provide the same node, albeit with
different properties.

This is an issue, as BioCypher does not provide a way to fuse both nodes in a
single one, while keeping all the properties. As of version 0.5, it will use
the last seen node, and discard the first one(s), effectively loosing
information (albeit with a warning).
With a raw Biocypher adapter, the only way to solve this problem is to implement
a single adapter, which reconciliate the data before producing nodes, which
makes the task difficult and the adapter code even harder to understand.


#### Reconciliation

OntoWeaver provides a way to solve the reconciliation problem
with its *high-level information fusion* feature. The fusion features allow to
reconciliate the nodes and edges produced by various *independent* adapters,
by adding a final step on the aggregated list of nodes and edges.

The generic workflow is to first produce nodes and edges —as usual—
then call the `fusion.reconciliate` function on the produced nodes and edges:
```python
# Call the mappings:
adapter_A = ontoweaver.tabular.extract_all(input_table_A, mapping_A)
adapter_B = ontoweaver.tabular.extract_all(input_table_B, mapping_B)

# Aggregate the nodes and edges:
nodes = adapter_A.nodes + adapter_B.nodes
edges = adapter_A.edges + adapter_B.edges

# Reconciliate:
fused_nodes, fused_edges = ontoweaver.fusion.reconciliate(nodes, edges, separator=";")

# Then you can pass those to biocypher.write_nodes and biocypher.write_edges...
```

##### High-level Interface

OntoWeaver provides the `fusion.reconciliate` function, that implements a sane
default reconciliation of nodes. It merges nodes having the same identifier and
the same type, taking care of not losing any property. When nodes have
the same property field showing different values, it aggregates the values
in a list.

This means that if the two following nodes come from two different sources:
```python
# From source A:
("id_1", "type_A", {"prop_1": "x"}),
("id_1", "type_A", {"prop_2": "y"}),

# From source B:
("id_1", "type_A", {"prop_1": "z"})
```

Then, the result of the reconciliation step above would be:
```python
# Note how "x" and "z" are separated by separator=";".
("id_1", "type_A", {"prop_1": "x;z", "prop_2": "y"})
```


##### Mid-level Interfaces

The simplest approach to fusion is to define how to:

1. decide that two nodes are identical,
2. fuse two identifiers,
3. fuse two type labels, and
4. fuse two properties dictionaries, and then
5. let OntoWeaver browse the nodes by pairs, until everything is fused.

For step 1, OntoWeaver provides the `serialize` module, which allows to extract
the part of a node or an edge) that should be used when checking equality.

A node being composed of an identifier, a type label, and a properties dictionary,
the `serialize` module provides function objects reflecting the useful combinations
of those components:

- `ID` (only the identifier)
- `IDLabel` (the identifier and the type label)
- `All` (the identifier, the type label, and the properties)

The user can instantiate those function objects, and pass them to the
`congregate` module, to find which nodes are duplicates of each other.
For example:
```python
on_ID = serialize.ID() # Instantiation.
congregater = congregate.Nodes(on_ID) # Instantiation.
congregater(my_nodes) # Actual processing call.
# congregarter now holds a dictionary of duplicated nodes.
```

For steps 2 to 4, OntoWeaver provides the `merge` module, which provides ways
to merge two nodes' components into a single one. It is separated into two
submodules, depending on the type of the component:

- `string` for components that are strings (i.e. identifier and type label),
- `dictry` for components that are dictionaries (i.e. properties).

The `string` submodule provides:

- `UseKey`: replace the identifier with the serialization used at the congregation step,
- `UseFirst`/`UseLast`: replace the type label with the first/last one seen,
- `EnsureIdentical`: if two nodes' components are not equal, raise an error,
- `OrderedSet`: aggregate all the components of all the seen nodes into a single,
   lexicographically ordered list (joined by a user-defined separator).

The `dictry` submodule provides:

- `Append`: merge all seen dictionaries in a single one, and aggregate all the
  values of all the duplicated fields into a single lexicographically ordered
  list (joined by a user-defined separator).

For example, to fuse "congregated" nodes, one can do:
```python
    # How to merge two components:
    use_key    = merge.string.UseKey() # Instantiation.
    identicals = merge.string.EnsureIdentical()
    in_lists   = merge.dictry.Append(separator)

    # Assemble those function objects in an object that knows
    # how to apply them members by members:
    fuser = fuse.Members(base.Node,
            merge_ID    = use_key,    # How to merge two identifiers.
            merge_label = identicals, # How to merge two type labels.
            merge_prop  = in_lists,   # How to merge two properties dictionaries.
        )

    # Apply a "reduce" step (browsing pairs of nodes, until exhaustion):
    fusioner = Reduce(fuser) # Instantiation.
    fusioned_nodes = fusioner(congregater) # Call on the previously found duplicates.
```

Once this fusion step is done, is it possible that the edges that were defined
by the initial adapters refer to node IDs that do not exist anymore.
Fortunately, the fuser keeps track of which ID was replaced by which one.
And this can be used to remap the edges' *target* and *source* identifiers:
```python
remaped_edges = remap_edges(edges, fuser.ID_mapping)
```

Finally, the same fusion step can be done on the resulting edges (some of which
are now duplicates, because they were remapped):
```python
    # Find duplicates:
    on_STL = serialize.edge.SourceTargetLabel()
    edges_congregater = congregate.Edges(on_STL)
    edges_congregater(edges)

    # How to fuse them:
    set_of_ID       = merge.string.OrderedSet(separator)
    identicals      = merge.string.EnsureIdentical()
    in_lists        = merge.dictry.Append(separator)
    use_last_source = merge.string.UseLast()
    use_last_target = merge.string.UseLast()
    edge_fuser = fuse.Members(base.GenericEdge,
            merge_ID     = set_of_ID,
            merge_label  = identicals,
            merge_prop   = in_lists,
            merge_source = use_last_source,
            merge_target = use_last_target
        )

    # Fuse them:
    edges_fusioner = Reduce(edge_fuser)
    fusioned_edges = edges_fusioner(edges_congregater)
```

Because all those steps are performed onto OntoWeaver's internal classes,
they need to be converted back to Biocypher's tuples:
```python
    return [n.as_tuple() for n in fusioned_nodes], [e.as_tuple() for e in fusioned_edges]
```


##### Low-level Interfaces

Each of the steps mentioned in the previous section involves a functor class
that implements a step of the fusion process. Users may provide their own
implementation of those interfaces, and make them interact with the others.


The first function interface is the `congregate.Congregater`, whose role is to
consume a list of Biocypher tuples, find duplicated elements, and store them
in a dictionary mapping a key to a list of elements.

This allows to implementation of a de-duplication algorithm with a time complexity
in O(n·log n).

A `Congregater` is instantiated with a `serialize.Serializer`, indicating which
part of an element is to be considered when checking for equality.


The highest level fusion interface is `fusion.Fusioner`, whose role is to
process a `congregate.Congregater` and return a set of fusioned nodes.

OntoWeaver provides `fusion.Reduce` as an implementation of `Fusioner`,
which itself relies on an interface whose role is to fuse two elements:
`fuse.Fuser`.

OntoWeaver provides a `fuse.Members` as an implementation, which itself relies
on `merge.Merger`, which role is to fuse two elements' *components*.

So, from the lower to the higher level, the following three interfaces
can be implemented:

1. `merge.Merger` —(used by)→ `fuse.Members` —(used by)→ `fusion.Reduce`
2. `fuse.Fuser` —(used by)→ `fusion.Reduce`
3. `fusion.Fusioner`

For instance, if you need a different way to *merge* elements *components*,
you should implement your own `merge.Merger` and use it when instantiating
`fuse.Members`.

If you need a different way to *fuse* two *elements* (for instance for deciding
their type based on their properties), implement a `fuse.Fuser` and use it when
instantiating a `fusion.Reduce`.

If you need to decide how to fuse whole *sets* of duplicated nodes (for instance
if you need to know all duplicated nodes before deciding which type to set),
implement a `fusion.Fusioner` directly.
